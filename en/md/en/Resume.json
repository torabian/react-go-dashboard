Soon after few sprints, I've realised that there are two problems:\n* Software should run without a server, so I did convert the next.js to craco, and also due to having specific urls with dynamic Unique ids, I could not use the static exporting.\n* The final client introduced their own design system, which I had to use those components as much as possible. This thing itself took a long shot, due to webcomponents used in the project, and react wrapper was not that up-to-date.\nThe usage of react-query library was a huge help indeed, which helped to manage the errors, timeouts  and some layer of caching. In this project I have introduced common archive, single component manager.\nInstead of google maps, I had to use the ArcGIS javascript library. ArcGIS has different approach to maps, it's more useful in GIS heavy environments. The map in the center of screen, was mainly used for selecting area of interests, and it had to be done by various methods: Draw a polygon, Draw a rectangle, import shapefile, import geojson. I've worked a bit in depth with drawing tools, layers, cleaning layers, prevent overlapping areas, and spent adequet time learning ArcGIS documentations.\nFor the uploading geojson file and shapefiles, I provided two methods, first by choosing a file dialog, and second by dragging file in case you are in the map screen. I have implemented a dragzone,  which every component can listen two, and as many as handlers could be there to accept file by desired types.\nAuthentication used in this project was MSAL integration. Msal with react itself is a bit a challenge, also I understood that deeply in the azure configuration there are undocumented differences between 'Webapp' and 'SPA'. Took me few days of debugging for correct refresh token, signin, signout behavior.",

            "description": "React go dashboard (commercial demo name) or more precisely \"Fireback\", is a set of modules, codebase, framework which tends to help developer (originally developed for myself to build faster for clients) build long lasting, extremly performant, reliable software which runs on every platform, such as: Android, IOS, Wide webservers (Ubuntu, Windows, MIPS) Desktop applications, and microcontrollers, such as ESP32 from espressif.\nThe goal is, to build independent software from SaaS providers, which can run fully offline, can be hosted on premise or cloud, makes possible to collaborate, having full authentication flow, and standard requests, responses, query dsl all out of the box.\nAfter many years of developing, I had realised so many basic features, such as pagination, search, sorting, configurating database, logging, importing, exporting data, and many more, are usually missing in most of products. Poor UI, missing keyboard functionalities, heavy front-ends, or uncompiled source code on server side seemed to me a big problem in order to deliver high quality products. To answer all these I have created fireback, and as a demo, react go dashboard.\nWhen building a project on Fireback, you define most of the work in yaml configurations, and fireback code generator creates many functions required for those entities, create, edit, delete, advance query, searching, accessing them using CLI, GRPC, HTTP, permission system.\nFrom a backend perspective, project can be running monolith, or as microservice. It's very lightweight, as low as 8MB for linux servers on a mid size project, and does not depend on any external library, and does not need a docker to make sure it's running since there will be no requirement as such.\nFrom a front-end side, a full size project weights less than 800KB, and 300KB on first load, on a full size project, including mocks for testing, icons and so. It's so low in weight that I have embedded the UI directly into ESP32 chips which only can contain 4MB of flash memory.\nOn the mobile side, the same backend, and front-end can bundle into the cordova, and generate APK or IPA for Android and IOS Platforms. Backend can be removed from mobile, in case the app is fully running on cloud, and no extra code is needed. Backend is managed in a way which can save all the data on SQLite as well, without extra configuration other than specifying it's gonna run on a mobile device.\nOn the desktop side, it provides Linux, Windows, and Mac binaries, with or without backend, as low as 20MB for a full size project with backend. Having similar situation on mobile, it can work in many different setups and scenarios.\nDue to minimal usage of the external libraries in front-end, not only the UI is light, but also is fast, and MacOSX theme proves how near such apps can get to the native UI appearance just with CSS, including light and dark mode.\nReact go dashboard or Fireback, can also produce a lot of C code, such as entities and http routes, and give a lot of boilerplate for products which need to run on microcontrollers or low memory environments.",
            "start": 1643500800000000,
            "technicalDescription": "React Go Dashboard (Fireback) is written in Golang, C, JavaScript (React), TypeScript and SCSS, with some scripts.\nProject consists of main parts, called `cmd`, `core` and `modules`. In a Fireback project, we do not have such thing as one project, but rather, there are many modules, such as workspaces, roles, users, payment, which could combine inside a `cmd` folder, and generate a new product, for specific ARCH or operating system.\nFor example, when we are running app A on desktop, we omit workspaces library to some level, and do not  include the payment module in the binary because it just does not make sense when running offline, and on the cloud, they are very well included.\n## Backend part (Golang) \nis very well organized, it's based on relational database, mainly SQLite or MySQL, and heavily depends on entity concept. For every entity, Fireback creates:\n- CLI options, to create entities, get one, delete, bulk update, export or export to csv, json, yaml - When creating an entity, you can include other entities as child, single, array, object or many2many - Advanced validation on the entity, or on children. - Create sub entities (other modules which are child here), also update them on patch. - HTTP Requests, get, query with pagination, sorting, filters by each column - Mock system for entities, as well as seeder to contain the initial data of the project. For example, if you have a gender entity, you can define them in a yaml file, and system puts them into the database when starting. - GRPC Support for all actions. - Permissions being created and added to the system. All entities work under workspace, role and user, so there are no specific code or config required. Every content is bound to the current workspace. - Advanced translation system for entity, separate for each column on database. Fireback translates queries or getItemById upon sending accept-language in headers via GRPC, HTTP or CLI. - Migration codes in the database. - Proto definition files, both for automatic generated code and developer defined code.\n## Thirdparty SDKs, JavaScript, React.js\nFireback modules, all are exported to the JavaScript sdk, and React.js sdk. This feature is one of the pioneer options that helps front-end developers to use backend directly in their source code, instead of writing fetch, or http call codes, managing state, error handling, error messages, they would just call the exported functions, and underlying sdk (auto generated) would handle it for them.\nWith this feature not only we make coding faster, but also it's more clearer, since all the definition of request and responses are also included. It would remove the necessity of checking documents and intelisense would suggest fields, and possible responses directly into the IDE. Plus, if a feature is not supported by backend anymore, it would be compiler error on front-end to include those functions and it reduces the out of sync issues between backend and front-end to zero.\n## File uploads\nOne of the large issues which has been solved by Golang community and hence Fireback, is file upload. It has embedded the TUS upload framework, which allows reliable uploading, resumable uploads out of the box. In the front-end and as well as SDK, react hooks and JavaScript functions for uploading multiple files are provided. Drive module, handles the file uploads and after storing the uploaded content on the disk, Drive creates a record in File entities table, with all information of the owner, user created, file size and many more. All files are available both on download mode, and inline mode. Some minor work has been done for coverting files in the backend also but it's not major.\n## Packaging of the server side\nMajor target products now run on cloud hosting, and React go dashboard also generates Windows Server, Ubuntu Server, and even Mac Server binaries, and they all come with installers. All binaries both work with MySQL and SQLite, therefor front-end developers can install their own version of the backend, and if the project provides mocks, they would run the mocks and can start developing without the requirement of installing backend tools, such as Docker, heavy Java environments and many more. Initializing and configuration of the product comes with CLI, by calling `fireback init` it would ask the database credentials, the ports http server, and file server will be lifted, and creates `project-configuration.yml` on that directory. This easily allows for multiple environments on any project.\n## Front-end: React.js\nFireback also has a UI project, which is a react.js app, could be built either with Next.js or craco based on project need. It follows the backend API Response/Request structure, and contains a lof of ready to use components inside of it. Front-end does not force any libraries to be used, neither does not uses itself, other than react and few utilities. Entire style system is pure css (SCSS preprocessor) and comes with automatic/dark/light MacOSX theme. Theme system could be extended, and does not rely on JavaScript at all.\nProduct aims to be super light, without components entire build folder weights less than 250KB, and 820KB on a test with full modules and components on a microcontroller chip.\nFront-end also follows a multi target architecture, developer can build multiple products out of same source code, again without any external libraries, or monorepo, etc.\n\nAll these happens just by defining entities structure in the Module2.yml files",

As a team leader in this project, I had to build the major components of the app, lists, filters etc, api calls, forms, form validations and etc. Based on my role, I had direct contact with the client, and daily meeting with business analysts with developers to ensure everything was on the track, and I would report to delivery manager as well.\nAll of the fearures inside the app, are categorized by 3 sections (roles) inside the system:\n- Homeowners - Managers - Vendors.\n## Homeowners Home owners are people who basically own a house, might add several houses, giving the exact house location, area.\n## Manager Managers are people who are having a vote in the association board, they can accept requests such as repair, violations or committee voting\n## Vendors Vendors are the most limited people in the system, they only complete work order requests\n\n## Main features of the app\n### Accounting Solution contains a small accounting system, with the option to download the invoices, see the transactions, approve payments, etc It gives the software an option to set the payment method to stripe or wire transfer, by giving each payment method information Homeowners and vendors also can specifiy their bank account information, for management to use them for payments.\n### Document Center All documents across the system are accessible via Document Center, where users can delete, browse, check history of all the documents and files which has been shared between them. They could be downloaded, and PDF/Images could be seen inside app in a modal for ease of access.\n### Work Order This feature is a major one and important across the all roles, homeowners or managers can request a work order to be done. Work orders can be different types, such as repair, cutting grass, replace wires, and many more. Each request could be approved by a committee of managers, and then assigned to an specific vendor.\n### Violation Report Homeowners are able to report a violation to the association, such as wrong parking, damaging visual appreance of the block, or other kind of disrupting behavior.\n## Authentication system\nThe authentication was done using email or phone number, after you login in to your account, system checks how many roles are assigned to you, and if there is more than one, you can select that role. After selecting, you would be moved to your default screen. App does not provide a dashboard, but rather different archive component depending on the user role type.\nBeyond react-native app, there is a react.js app on the web version, mostly focused on the manager part, which had all of the features in the app before hand. I had to look at the API most of the time on the web version and replicate the functions on react native side.",

In fact it seems to be a simple thing, but it took a notable time to replace all screens page title with their main actions with a general component to prevent disorientation and flickering when screens were changed.",
